//! Abstraction around a Balancer pool factory.
//!
//! These factories are used for indexing pool events, fetching "permanent" pool
//! information (such as token addresses for pools) as well as pool "state"
//! (such as current reserve balances, and current swap fee).
//!
//! This abstraction is provided in a way to simplify adding new Balancer pool
//! types by just implementing the required `BalancerFactory` trait.
